<h3>Cryptochain</h3>

This is a mock project made for the purpose of learning and understanding the underlying principles of Blockchain technology.

The Cryptochain project is a simple simulator of cryptocurrency and blockchain. <br /> 
This project encompasses features like Creating a Wallet, Conducting Transactions across Wallets, Mining Blocks and subsequent Reward generation, and Broadcasting the mined blocks to all the peers in the network. <br />
The technologies used here are: NodeJS for Back-end, and ReactJS for Front-end.

In order to put the application to use, you need to install NodeJS in your system. <br />
Then, clone this repository into your desired directory and install the dependencies mentioned in the package.json file using <br />
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; <code>npm install</code> <br />
Start the Master Development Node using <br />
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; <code>npm run dev</code> <br />
Start the peer nodes using <br />
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; <code>npm run dev-peer</code>

To access the User Interface, open your web browser and enter - http://localhost:[PORT_NUMBER] <br />
[PORT_NUMBER]  = 3000 (If you wish to access the Master Development Node) <br />
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &nbsp;= The port number mentioned in the command prompt where the peer-node is started (If you wish to access a peer node).
